## Synopsis

This is my personal site. I would like to make it a bit different, I will be adding some animations with Velocity.js, and transformations of CSS.

## Motivation

I would like to learn a bit more about animations, take them to mobile, make them responsive, and implement somethings I learnt from Udacity course.

## Installation

Actually I added a file thats call compresser, in order to just minify some things.

To run the project you will need to execute: $ npm install

## API

None.

## Tests

TODO
